<h3>What is a table?</h3>
<p>
    A table is used in many different ways, from showing results between multiple sources, or even creating groups of certain resources. </p>

<p> 
Below is an example of a table that is used to create a student list, with their class and passing grade.
</p>      
         
        <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Students</th><th>Class</th><th>Passing grade</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>s244247</td><td>HIT226</td><td>HD</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>s245135</td><td>HIT226</td><td>D</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>s124785</td><td>HIT226</td><td>C</td>
            </tr>
         
        </table>

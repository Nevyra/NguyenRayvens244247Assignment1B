    <h3>What is a Living Style Guide</h3>
    
<p> In the world of programming, the process of documentation is often the weakest point for a programmer, there are often times where it is the most essential part of a project for a programmer. due to it being a reference point for developers and designers, the Living Style Guide comes in handy for useful information such as button themes, logos, layouts, overviews and colour palettes.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is a Living Style Guide useful to developers and designers</h3>

    <h3>My list of Living Style Guide tips</h3>
    
<ol> 1. Allow for critisism and open ideas, putting ideas onto the table will always help in improving the current project stages. </ol>
    
   <ol> 2. Dont try to make everything perfect, always be open to different scenarios and try to make it work. good things arent made in one go. </ol>
    
   <ol> 3. Make sure you have the essential elements: information about logos, colour palettes, have an overview of the project and always eager to work rationally. </ol>
    
   <ol> 4. Create a easy to read step by step guide, preferbly with photos or other infographics that will help with understanding the steps. </ol>

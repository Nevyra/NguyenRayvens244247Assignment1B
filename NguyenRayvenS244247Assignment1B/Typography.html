    <p class="animation">
    <a href="http://skylinevapor.com/">SkyLine</a>
    <img width="20%" src="images/Typography.JPG" alt="Image unrecovered">

<script type="text/javascript" src="js/Animation.js"></script>
    

<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p> The first step in making typography is choosing a Font. The difference between the two is that the font is a set of text characters that can be printed in specific style, and thus made into a type face. 
</p>
<p>The default font used in most sites is either sans-serif, Arial or Helvetica. The reason for this is because of their easy accessibility, which should always be taken into consideration when designing a website.</p>
    
<p>Here are some exaples of fonts</p>
  
<img width="10%" src="images/font.JPG" alt="Image unrecovered">
    
<ol>

<li1 class="Verdana">Verdana
<br />
    (Lower case = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Upper case = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.)</li1>
<br />
    <br />
<li2 class="Times">Times
<br />
    (Lower case = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Upper case = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.)</li2>
<br />
    <br />
<li3>Broadway
<br />
    (Lower case = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Upper case = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.)</li3>
<br />
    <br />
<li4 class="Georgia">Georgia
<br />
    (Lower case = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Upper case = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.)</li4>
<br />
    <br />
<li5 class="Tahoma">Tahoma
<br />
    (Lower case = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Upper case = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.)</li5>
<br />

</ol>
    
<h3>Font Styles and Sizings</h3>    
    
<p>Font styles are important, but so are font sizes!</p>

<img width="60%" src="images/fontsizes.JPG" alt="Image Unrecovered">
    
<p>Then you must decide on the size and weight of the chosen font/typeface. From there you can choose from many different types of styles such as ascender, descender, baseline, or kerning. </p> 
    
<p>Finally you should add spaces, Capitals or transparency to the font so that it suites the genre and setting of the website. Examples below:</p>    
    
<img width="40%" src="images/typo3.png" alt="Image Unrecovered">
